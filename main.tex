\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


The project intends to meet this need by analyzing historical data on two prominent crypto currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and comparing their recent transaction prices, volumes, and general trends\cite{nils_2022}. Utilizing cutting-edge data visualization technologies, the project will provide valuable insights into the performance of these crypto currencies and enable users to recognize patterns and trends that can inform their investment strategies.

The visualization will include a line chart of virtual currency prices, representing the historical price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum in a plain and concise manner\cite{orac_2021}. Users will be able to evaluate the relative performance of these crypto currencies and identify periods of growth, decline, and stability using the chart. In addition, a stack area depiction of transaction percentage will be created to provide an all-encompassing view of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading volume over time. This visualization will enable users to comprehend the market dynamics and trading activity surrounding these crypto currencies, as well as identify periods of increased market liquidity and interest.

By providing these user-friendly visual tools, the project hopes to contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding crypto currencies and aid investors, traders, and other stakeholders in the crypto currencies space in making informed decisions\cite{sun}. The project's ultimate goal is to improve users' access to and comprehension of crypto currencies market trends, enabling them to make more informed decisions in the swiftly evolving world of digital assets.

\section{Related Work}
In recent years, research on crypto currencies and their market trends has expanded swiftly, and numerous studies have examined various aspects of the crypto currency market. The work of Yermack\cite{Yermack2013}, which investigated the potential of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and store of value and analysed the regulatory challenges and opportunities it presents, is one of the most influential studies in this field. 

In addition, Bohme et al. \cite{Bohme2015} investigated the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin transactions, as well as potential assaults and countermeasures in the Bitcoin network. Similarly, Zohar's \cite{Zohar2015BitcoinUT} work addressed Bitcoin's scalability issues and proposed a new framework for enhancing the transaction throughput of the Bitcoin network.

Moreover, numerous studies have investigated the relationship between the crypto currency market and the traditional financial market. For example, Kristoufek \cite{Kristoufek2014} analysed the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional assets like gold, energy, and stocks. Corbet et al. \cite{Corbet2018} also investigated the dynamic correlations between Bitcoin and other financial assets, such as commodities, currencies, and stock indices.

In conclusion, there is a vast corpus of literature on crypto currencies and their market trends, covering a range of topics including security, privacy, scalability, regulation, co-movements with traditional assets, mining, and consensus mechanisms. This paper seeks to contribute to this expanding body of knowledge by providing an insightful data visualisation of the historical trends of Bitcoin and Ethereum, two prominent crypto currencies.
